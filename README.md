A Healthy LLM Pipeline for Medical Question Answering
Goal:
Answer health-related questions using a pre-trained LLM, augmented with a small medical knowledge base.
Bonus: Why this is a Healthy LLM Setup
Efficient: Uses LoRA instead of full fine-tuning

Multilingual-ready: Uses mT5

Clean inputs: Structured QA prompts

Knowledge-aware: Optional retrieval with RAG

Modular: Each part (retrieval, model, prompt) is replaceable or upgradeable
